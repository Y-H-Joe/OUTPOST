HMB-1 gene was chromosomally located as part of a Tn 3 family transposon that was named Tn 6345, where expression of bla HMB-1 in E. coli TOP10 led to increased resistance to β-lactams.

>card~~~Mycobacterium_tuberculosis_intrinsic_murA_conferring_resistance_to_fosfomycin~~~HE608151:1472986-1474243 Mycobacterium tuberculosis murA confers intrinsic resistance to fosfomycin. The presence of an aspartic acid residue in place of the critical cysteine at position 117 that enables fosfomycin binding is believed to be responsible for this intrinsic resistance.
